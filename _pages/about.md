I am a PhD student at CREST, ENSAE, working under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](http://marcocuturi.net). My research is focused on applying tools from the optimal transport theory to machine learning, with a particular interest in unsupervised problems.

## News ##

I have received a postdoctoral fellowship from [DIM Math Innov](https://www.dim-mathinnov.fr/en/postdoctoral-laureates-45.htm) to join the [Sierra](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/) team this Fall. Looking forward to it!

### Upcoming Events ###
* [26/10/2020] I will defend my thesis, *Leveraging Regularization, Projections and Elliptical Distributions in Optimal Transport*, at ENSAE.

### Recent Events ###
* [26/09/2020] Our paper "[Entropic Optimal Transport between (Unbalanced) Gaussian Measures has a Closed Form](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02572)" has been accepted to NeurIPS 2020 for an oral!
