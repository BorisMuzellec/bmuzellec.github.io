I am a PhD student at CREST, ENSAE, working under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](http://marcocuturi.net). My research is focused on applying tools from the optimal transport theory to machine learning, with a particular interest in unsupervised problems.

## News ##

I received a postdoctoral fellowship from [DIM Math Innov](https://www.dim-mathinnov.fr/en/postdoctoral-laureates-45.htm) to join the [Sierra](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/) team this Fall. Looking forward to it!

### Upcoming Events ###
* [16-17/07/2020] I will present our paper "[Missing Data Imputation using Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03860)" at [ICML 2020](https://icml.cc/virtual/2020/poster/6455) at 9pm Thursday and 8am Friday (CEST).

### Recent Events ###
* [03/06/2020] New preprint: "[Entropic Optimal Transport between (Unbalanced) Gaussian Measures has a Closed Form](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02572)". Joint work with [Hicham Janati](https://hichamjanati.github.io), [Gabriel Peyr√©](http://www.gpeyre.com) and [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net).
