## About me ##

I am post-doctoral researcher at [Sierra](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/), funded by [DIM Math Innov](https://www.dim-mathinnov.fr/en/postdoctoral-laureates-45.htm). I defended my PhD in October 2020 at ENSAE, where I worked under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](http://marcocuturi.net).

## Research interests ##

My research is focused on applying tools from the optimal transport theory to machine learning, with a particular interest for special cases for which optimal transport admits closed-form expressions.

## News ##

I defended my thesis on the 26th of October: here are the [slides](https://borismuzellec.github.io/publications/slides_defense.pdf) of the defense, and the [manuscript](https://borismuzellec.github.io/publications/thesis_muzellec.pdf).

### Upcoming events ###
* [06/01/2020] I will give a talk at the [Statistics-Econometrics-Machine Learning Seminar](https://statecoml.github.io) at ENSAE, on missing data imputation with optimal transport.



### Recent events ###
