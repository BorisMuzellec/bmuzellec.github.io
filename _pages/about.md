## About me ##

I am a post-doctoral researcher at [Sierra](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/), funded by [DIM Math Innov](https://www.dim-mathinnov.fr/en/postdoctoral-laureates-45.htm). I defended my PhD in October 2020 at ENSAE, where I worked under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](http://marcocuturi.net).

## Research interests ##

My research is focused on applying tools from the optimal transport theory to machine learning, and vice-versa.

## News ##

I defended my thesis on the 26th of October: here are the [slides](https://borismuzellec.github.io/publications/slides_defense.pdf) of the defense, and the [manuscript](https://borismuzellec.github.io/publications/thesis_muzellec.pdf).
