I am a PhD student at CREST, ENSAE, working under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](http://marcocuturi.net). My research is focused on applying tools from the optimal transport theory to machine learning, with a particular interest in unsupervised problems.

## News ##

I am currently looking for a postdoctoral position in Paris! Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have an open position.

### Upcoming Events ###
* [12-18/07/2020] I will present our paper "[Missing Data Imputation using Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03860)" at [ICML 2020](https://icml.cc).

### Recent Events ###
* [01/06/2020] Our work "[Missing Data Imputation using Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03860)" has been accepted to [ICML 2020](https://icml.cc).
* [09-13/03/2020] I participated in the [Optimization for Machine Learning](https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2133.html) workshop at CIRM, Marseille.
